"*NSA = Nutrition Service and Administrative costs.  Approximately two-thirds of total costs are used to provide nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion and support, and linkages to health and other client services (e.g.,immunization; drug, alcohol and tobacco education; referrals to family and child health social programs).  The remaining third is used for traditional management functions. 

The annual average food cost is the benefit per month. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
